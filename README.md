[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a simple example of how to use Spring Application Context and Dependency Injection, along with Inversion of Control (IoC), in a Spring Boot 2 application, following SOLID Principles and doing some basic JUnit5 unitary tests.
Stereotype annotations used: @Service, @Component, @Profile, @Primary, @Controller, @Autowired, @Qualifier and test annotations. For more info read the project comments at each class, mainly at the Main class.<br>

This repository is a single-project repo with Git version control.

Some of my repositories are for backup only, each of them being a collection of tens of projects inside one same repo (with no individual version control for each project), and others are single-project repositores (with effective version control for that single project). As a distinction between them, the backup repos are named in uppercase with underscores (e.g. SPRING3) while the single-project ones are named in lowercase with dashes (e.g. springboot2-ac-di).
